Spec

Create a Ruby on Rails app, that given an input of the name of the city, display the 16 day weather forecast using the [http://openweathermap.org/forecast16](http://openweathermap.org/forecast16) API(need to request a free API Key). See this image for inspiration: [http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Forecast.png](http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Forecast.png)

- [ ] A good example of the flow would be, to show an text input, when the user enter a city name, a request is made to the API, which will return the city 16 days forecast

- [ ] This would show another page with the 16 days forecast and the simplest data like date and average temperature. Then when the user clicks on a specific day widget, brings up another page with the rest of the details like wind direction, precipitation, etc.

- [ ] We are looking for at least 1 test (Integration/Components/Unit/Acceptance),
- [ ] a simple CI (Continuous Integration) server working
- [ ] a CD (Continuous Deployment) server working (avoid Heroku if you can)

Note:

CSS/Styles are a bonus to have not critical. We are expecting clean code, adhering to the community standards and rails conventions.
